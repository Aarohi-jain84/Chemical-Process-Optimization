## Chemical Process Optimization Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to optimize chemical process parameters for improved performance. By analyzing a dataset containing various input variables (such as temperature, pressure, reactant concentrations) and output variables (such as product yield or purity), the goal is to build predictive models that estimate process outcomes and recommend optimal conditions.

## Objectives

Develop regression models to predict chemical process outputs based on input parameters.

Compare different machine learning algorithms to select the best-performing model.

Use optimization methods to find the set of input parameters that maximize desired output (e.g., yield).

Visualize data relationships and model predictions for better interpretability.

Demonstrate a complete data science workflow from data preprocessing to optimization.

## Dataset
The dataset contains chemical process records with the following features:

Input variables: Temperature, Pressure, Concentration of reactants, Catalyst amount, Reaction time, etc.

Output variables: Product yield, Purity, Reaction completion percentage.

The data is either sourced from publicly available chemical process datasets or simulated to resemble real industrial process data.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Clean data, handle missing values, scale/normalize features as needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize input and output distributions, feature correlations, and relationships.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Train multiple regression models — Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting — and evaluate using RMSE and R² scores.

Feature Engineering:
Create or select important features based on domain knowledge and model insights.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Improve model performance using Grid Search or Random Search.

Optimization:
Use the best model in conjunction with optimization algorithms to find input conditions that maximize yield or purity.

Visualization:
Present results using plots such as scatter plots, feature importance charts, and optimization response surfaces.
